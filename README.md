# ALT1 YouTube App
See: https://runeapps.org/forums/viewtopic.php?pid=5473#p5473  

Great news - I've taken a look at the old YouTube app and got the app back in action with some simple fixes.  
You can now access the new YouTube app using the following link: ```alt1://addapp/https://nigel1992.github.io/Alt1-YouTube-App//appconfig.json``` or use the link ```https://nigel1992.github.io/Alt1-YouTube-App/``` in Alt1 Browser, and click ADD APP.  
(Simply paste into your browser's navigation bar and hit ENTER)
